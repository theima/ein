# Emce State Router

This is a system for managing state in an [Emce](https://github.com/theima/emce) application.

This is still early in the development process, lots of things will change. Below is a short description of how the library will work. 

This library will focus on defining states for your applications model. Moving to a new state is done through a transition.

The url can be updated based on state, but it should be seen as another representation of your model.

The url can be translated back into transition actions if it is updated through other means, such as clicking the back button.
